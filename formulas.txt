General Health:

y = 1-(age/100)^8

Death chance:

Take into account self.overallHealth [Lower the chance]
Take into account self.ageEffects[1] [Increase or Lower]
Take into account self.bloodType  [lower if bad]
    > CONSTANTS["diseaseConstants]["bloodTypeMostEffected"]
    # Should it be called effect or changed to another name 
    > CONSTANTS["diseaseConstants]["bloodTypeEffect]

random_number < death chance 

If not dead:
reduce general health by the difference 

random_value - death_chance = difference 

gen = 1- (age/100)**difference
